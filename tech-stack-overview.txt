🚀 Miles Waite's Tech Stack & AI Portfolio Overview

Hey Facebook friends! 👋 I wanted to share what I've been building - it's pretty exciting stuff that combines cutting-edge web tech with AI innovation!

🎯 The Big Picture
I've built an intelligent portfolio website that doesn't just show my work - it talks back to visitors using AI! Think of it as a smart assistant that knows everything about my projects and can answer questions about my expertise in real-time.

💻 Core Tech Stack

Frontend Magic:
- Next.js 15 with App Router (latest React framework)
- TypeScript for bulletproof code
- Tailwind CSS for beautiful, responsive design
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Three.js + React Three Fiber for stunning 3D graphics (including that rotating cylinder animation!)

Backend & AI:
- Node.js API endpoints
- Groq AI (Llama 3.1 8B model) for lightning-fast responses
- Vercel Edge Functions for global performance
- Custom RAG Architecture (this is the cool part!)

🧠 The RAG System - Why It's Revolutionary

What is RAG? 
RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's like giving AI a super-powered memory that can instantly find relevant information from my entire knowledge base.

How It Works:
1. You ask a question (e.g., "Tell me about your TouchDesigner work")
2. AI searches my knowledge base using smart keyword matching
3. Finds relevant projects/expertise (TouchDesigner modular systems, MIDI integration, etc.)
4. Builds a context-aware response using that specific information
5. Gives you a personalized answer based on my actual work

Why This Matters:
- No more generic responses - every answer is tailored to my specific expertise
- Real-time learning - the more questions asked, the better it gets
- Context awareness - understands complex technical concepts
- Measurable engagement - tracks what people are most interested in

🎨 What Makes It Special

3D Visualizations:
- Custom Three.js cylinder animation with red/green/white rotating segments
- Real-time geometry generation
- Responsive across all devices

Smart Knowledge Management:
- 6 major project categories (from Energy Trading Risk Systems to TouchDesigner modular architectures)
- 9 expertise areas (Complex Adaptive Systems, Antifragile Design, Real-time Systems, etc.)
- Music inspirations (Brian Eno, Harold Budd, Richard Devine, Nick McCabe)
- Dynamic content updates without code changes

Performance & Analytics:
- Sub-second response times
- Edge deployment for global speed
- Vercel Analytics tracking user engagement
- Conversation analytics to understand visitor interests

🏗️ Technical Architecture

Modular Design:
- 9-module TouchDesigner system with persistent storage
- Event-driven MIDI brain with <5ms latency
- JSON-based configuration with backup systems
- Multi-environment deployment (dev/staging/prod)

Enterprise Experience:
- Led 15-developer teams at E.ON Energy Trading
- 120+ user risk management platforms
- 25,000 Monte Carlo simulations
- Real-time risk reporting (next-day → within-day delivery)

🎵 Creative Tech Integration

TouchDesigner Expertise:
- Modular audio-reactive visual systems
- MIDI integration with Python state management
- Emergent geometry generation
- Pattern learning algorithms

Music & Technology:
- Inspired by Brian Eno's generative music approach
- Harold Budd's mastery of space and silence
- Richard Devine's modular synthesis systems
- Creating systems where simple rules lead to complex behaviors

🌟 Why This Matters for Business

For Clients:
- Self-serve detailed project information - reduces back-and-forth
- Demonstrates AI expertise in practice
- Shows complex systems thinking in action
- Proves technical leadership capabilities

For Me:
- Iterative content strategy - quick project publishing
- Measurable engagement through AI interactions
- Practical AI ROI demonstration
- Portfolio that evolves with new conversations

🔮 The Philosophy

Building systems that are:
- Robust (withstand stress)
- Antifragile (improve under stress) 
- Emergent (exhibit complex behaviors from simple rules)

This isn't just a portfolio - it's a living demonstration of complex adaptive systems thinking applied to real-world problems!

Want to try it? Visit mileswaite.net and ask the AI chatbot anything about my work - it knows everything! 🤖✨

P.S. - The rotating cylinder animation on the homepage? That's Three.js in action, with each segment rotating at different speeds to create that mesmerizing effect. Pure mathematics meets visual art! 🎨
