      <p><em>How I built a page-aware, voice-controlled AI assistant that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices</em></p>

      <h2>The Vision: Why Build This?</h2>
      <p>As a developer working on complex systems and experimental music projects, I wanted my portfolio to reflect the cutting-edge nature of my work. The idea of a voice-activated AI assistant that could understand context and provide intelligent responses about my projects felt like the perfect showcase of modern web technologies.</p>

      <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
      <p>This was a complex project involving Web Speech API, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and mobile optimization. The key challenges were making voice recognition work reliably across different browsers and devices, especially mobile.</p>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Voice recognition with fallback to text input</li>
        <li>Page-aware contextual responses</li>
        <li>Facebook Messenger-style chat widget</li>
        <li>Mobile-optimized design</li>
        <li>Persistent conversation history</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The voice assistant now works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, providing contextual, intelligent responses about my projects and work. It's become a key differentiator for my portfolio.</p>
