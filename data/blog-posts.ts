      <h1>Building a Voice-Activated, Page-Aware AI Assistant</h1>

      <br>

      <h2><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>
      <p>Portfolio sites are static. Visitors scan content, leave, and rarely engage deeply. I wanted something different: an interface that responds to context, understands intent, and works as naturally on mobile as it does on desktop.</p>

      <br>

      <h2><strong>The Approach</strong></h2>
      <p>The system combines three core technologies: Web Speech API for voice recognition, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for intelligent responses, and context injection to understand which page the user is viewing.</p>

      <br>
      
      <p> <strong>Page awareness</strong> means the assistant knows where you are. Ask "What's this about" on the projects page versus the now page, and you get different, contextually relevant answers. The system passes current page metadata, content structure, and user location to the AI model before generating responses.</p>

      <br>
      
      <p> <strong>Voice-first design</strong> solves mobile UX challenges. Typing on mobile is slow and error-prone. Speaking is 3x faster and requires less cognitive load. The interface degrades gracefully: if voice recognition fails or isn't supported, users can type instead.</p>

      <br>

      <h2><strong>Technical Architecture</strong></h2>

      <br>
      
      <h3><strong>Voice Input Layer</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>• Web Speech API handles voice-to-text conversion</li>
        <li>• Real-time transcription displays as users speak</li>
        <li>• Automatic stop after 3 seconds of silence</li>
        <li>• Manual stop via double-click interaction</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h3><strong>Context Layer</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>• Extracts current page path, title, and main content</li>
        <li>• Builds structured context object with page metadata</li>
        <li>• Injects relevant information into prompt before API call</li>
        <li>• Caches page contexts to reduce redundant processing</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h3><strong>RAG System</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>• Vector embeddings of portfolio content</li>
        <li>• Semantic search retrieves relevant context</li>
        <li>• Claude API generates responses using retrieved information</li>
        <li>• Responses limited to verified, context-specific information</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h3><strong>Interface Layer</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>• Facebook Messenger-style chat widget</li>
        <li>• Toast notifications for quick responses</li>
        <li>• Persistent conversation history within session</li>
        <li>• Mobile-optimized touch interactions</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h2><strong>Implementation Challenges</strong></h2>

      <br>
      
      <p><strong>Cross-browser voice recognition</strong> was the first hurdle. iOS Safari and Chrome handle the Web Speech API differently. Safari requires explicit user gestures and doesn't support continuous listening. The solution: detect browser capabilities and adjust behavior accordingly.</p>

      <br>
      
      <p><strong>Mobile performance</strong> required careful optimization. Voice processing, context extraction, and API calls need to complete in under 2 seconds to feel responsive. Implemented request cancellation for concurrent queries, context caching with 5-minute TTL, and edge functions for reduced latency.</p>

      <br>
      
      <p><strong>Context relevance</strong> demanded experimentation. Early versions passed too much page data, creating noisy prompts. The system now extracts only essential information: page type, primary headings, and a 500-character content summary. This keeps prompts focused and responses accurate.</p>

      <br>

      <h2><strong>Current State</strong></h2>
      
      <p>The assistant handles conversational queries about my work, projects, and background. Response time averages 1.8 seconds on mobile, 1.2 seconds on desktop. Voice recognition accuracy sits around 85-90% in typical environments.</p>
      
      <p>It works across iOS Safari, Chrome (desktop and Android), and Edge. Firefox has limited Web Speech API support, so the system defaults to text input.</p>
      
      <p>Users can ask questions like "What technologies do you work with" or "Tell me about the Lorenz visualization" and receive contextually appropriate responses based on their current page.</p>

      <br>

      <h2><strong>Trade-offs</strong></h2>
      
      <p>Voice interfaces aren't universally better. They require microphone permissions, work poorly in noisy environments, and some users simply prefer typing. The system accommodates both interaction modes rather than forcing voice-first.</p>
      
      <p>Page awareness adds complexity. Every query requires context extraction and processing. For static content, this overhead might not justify the benefit. For a portfolio showcasing AI capabilities, it demonstrates technical depth.</p>

      <br>

      <h2><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h2>
      
      <br>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start with text, add voice second.</strong> Building the chat interface first made voice integration cleaner. Voice became an input method rather than the entire feature.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Context quality matters more than quantity.</strong> Sending less, more relevant information produces better responses than dumping entire page content into prompts.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Mobile-first isn't optional.</strong> Over 60% of portfolio traffic comes from mobile devices. A feature that works poorly on mobile effectively doesn't work.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Graceful degradation is critical.</strong> Voice recognition fails. APIs timeout. Browsers lack support. The system needs fallback paths at every layer.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h2><strong>Try It</strong></h2>
      
      <p>Visit any page and click the chat icon. Ask about projects, technologies, or current work. The assistant understands context and provides relevant responses.</p>
      
      <p>Or just type if you prefer. Both work.</p>
